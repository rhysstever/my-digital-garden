# Discovery of the Khitonian River
## Reasons to Journey 
When [[Settlements/Zanapool|Zanapool]] was founded, Yhorian merchants' main route had them sail down the [[Settlements/Zanapool|Zanapool]] river, then north, heading counter-clockwise around the continent. From there, they would sail west into the [[POIs/Sea of Yhor|Sea of Yhor]] to [[Settlements/Yhora (City)|Yhora (City)]]. This route, however, took a long time and exposed ships to the dangerous ocean waters. 

Eager to find a quicker and safer route, [[People/Jaayfin Oakroot II|Jaayfin Oakroot II]] looked to a find an option via land. They knew [[Settlements/Zanapool|Zanapool]] was built into the southern face of a group of mountains, and these were possibly the same mountains that sat south of [[Settlements/Adaham|Adaham]]. 

## Travels
After getting funding from a wealthy Yhorian merchant, [[People/Jaayfin Oakroot II|Jaayfin Oakroot II]] sailed from [[Settlements/Yhora (City)|Yhora (City)]] to [[Settlements/Zanapool|Zanapool]]. He set out west of [[Settlements/Zanapool|Zanapool]], staying close to southern edge of mountains.

## Results
[[People/Jaayfin Oakroot II|Jaayfin Oakroot II]] returned to [[Settlements/Yhora (City)|Yhora (City)]] with his notes and findings, sending his results to his patron and then releasing it to the public. Although the entire journey took close to a year, [[People/Jaayfin Oakroot II|Jaayfin Oakroot II]]'s new land route to [[Settlements/Zanapool|Zanapool]] would be much quicker. 

Once [[People/Jaayfin Oakroot II|Jaayfin Oakroot II]]'s findings hit the public, the [[Nations/Yhorian Empire|Yhorian Empire]] swiftly claimed the land west of [[Settlements/Zanapool|Zanapool]]. Soon, a bridge was built to cross the Khitonian River and many trade routes were established. While some merchants decided to keep their pre-existing sea trade routes, this new land route provided much safer trade throughout the eastern region of the [[Nations/Yhorian Empire|Yhorian Empire]], bolstering to economies of [[Settlements/Kanta|Kanta]] and [[Settlements/Adaham|Adaham]].
