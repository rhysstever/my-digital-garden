# Mirthvale Swamp
The Mirthvale Swamp, or Mirthvale for short, is a wetland in western [[Continents/Ezavriel|Ezavriel]]. It is south of the [[POIs/Willowdust Woods|Willowdust Woods]] and west of [[Settlements/Opira|Opira]]. A mountain range separates the Mirthvale from the [[Nations/Wayward Coast|Wayward Coast]]. The combination of nutrient-rich soil and fresh water runoff from the mountains, allows for ample plant growth throughout the region.
