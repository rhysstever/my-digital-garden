# Wayward Isles
The Wayward Isles are a set of small islands out the western coast of [[Continents/Ezavriel|Ezavriel]]. The islands are self-sufficient, and they frequently trade amongst each other. 

The islands originally governed themselves, before merchants and missionaries sailed out of [[Settlements/Esila|Esila]]. At first, they were rejected and ignored by the islanders. However, after some were taught the Way of the Sun and Moon, the outsiders were slowly welcomed into society. 

As more missionaries arrived on the isles, more islanders were converted. When a majority of the inhabitants followed the Way of the Sun and Moon, [[Settlements/Esila|Esila]] proclaimed sovereignty of the isles. 

As [[Settlements/Esila|Esila]]'s influence grew, the [[Nations/Wayward Coast|Wayward Coast]] was established to be continentally recognized, and thus the Wayward Isles were named. 

After the [[Nations/Wayward Coast|Wayward Coast]] waned, the islands returned to their original state of governing themselves.
